    <h1 class="display-4 text-warning font-weight-bold">5 Important  Concepts every Programmer must know</h1>
    <h4>1)Java First Program</h4><p class="lead ">Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms.
Java is fast, reliable, and secure. Java is used in every nook and corner from desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet.

Java is easy to learn, and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. It is based on C++ (so easier for programmers who know C++).

The process of Java programming can be simplified in three steps: </p>
<p>
Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file – HelloWorld.java.
Compile it by typing “javac HelloWorld.java” in the terminal window.
Execute (or run) it by typing “java HelloWorld” in the terminal window.
The below-given program is the most simple program of Java printing “Hello World” to the screen. Let us try to understand every bit of code step by step.
</p>

<p>
<p>// A Java program to print "Hello World" </p>
<p>public class GFG { </p>
    <p>public static void main(String args[]) </p>
   <p> { </p>
      <p>  System.out.println("Hello World"); </p>
   <p> } </p>
<p>}</p>

<p>
Output 
Hello, World</p>
	<h4>2)OOPS</h4><p class="lead ">As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. </p>
	<h4>3)String Handing</h4><p class="lead ">Sting is basically an object that reperesents sequence of char values.An arrya of character works same as java string.</p>
	<h4>4)Exception Handing</h4><p class="lead ">Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.
</p>
	<h4>5)Java Collections</h4><p class="lead ">A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices.
The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.
Two nodes are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.</p>
